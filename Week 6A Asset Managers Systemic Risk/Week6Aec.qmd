14. Most of the comments are from asset managers similar to Blackrock or government/instutions that represent the intresets of asset managers. These comments are usually disagree with the SEC about the systemic risk associated with asset managers and want to reduce "harmful" regulation in the industry. I also think there is a marketing aspect to their comments to show that asset managers aren't "bad people"
